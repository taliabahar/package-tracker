# Package Tracker 

For my Interaction Design (CMSI-370) project I created a web app that consolidates shipments so users can easily and more efficiently track their packages. I wireframed then created a single-page React Hooks web app designed to satisfy Nielson’s 5 usability metrics that tracks packages given a carrier and tracking number. Researched popular usability guidelines and utilized the Shippo and Mapbox API to display a package’s current status and location on a map within a React Modal.

To run app must run `node node-http-relay.js` while in `src` folder THEN `npm install` and `npm start` in a new tab
